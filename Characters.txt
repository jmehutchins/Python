Yunchi is a robo-cat with artificial feline intelligence. Yunchi\'92s origin is unclear, having come to Ames and Cecile Cast through a shipment that was returned to Cast Shipping Co. in a crate labeled \'93Undeliverable\'94. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to reach the origin and destination contacts, the Casts gave the robo-cat \'97 the only item in the crate \'97 to their three-year-old son, Kyle, who had been nicknamed \'93Kitten\'94 (\'93Kits\'94 for short) for his love of feline holographic wonder tales.}
